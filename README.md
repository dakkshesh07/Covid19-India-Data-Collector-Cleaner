# Covid19-India-Data-Collector-Cleaner
This a data collector/cleaner program for covid19 in india which saves the results in a .csv file

How to use this program(this program can only be used as a import package for now)
1.Download the package from github as a zip file
2.Extract the file to unzip its contents
3.open the folder and open your cmd/terminal in that folder to install the pip packages using the requirements.txt
4.run the .py file in the folder

5. when you will run the programm it will start the program and it will now ask a input for which state's data you want:
   if you need the country's whole data then give 'Total' as the input
   if you need particual state's data then give the state's name as input(the input in case sensetive and need space in required places, for eg:- Tamil Nadu)

After this the program will grab the data from www.covid19india.org and clean it and save it as a .csv file in the same folder
If you run the program forever as it is a loop, then it will grab latest data every 1 min and save it by replacing the old one if it exsits
